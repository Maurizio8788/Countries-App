# COUNTRIES APP 

Countries app is a small study application based on the challenge on the site:

[FrontEnd Mentor link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca)

It's a working application showing my first work on the Node js-Angular stack and using SQL SERVER as db.

The layout has a built-in dark theme and light theme system and is perfectly responsive:

We can also notice the presence of the ORM Sequelize to make this my first Angular app, a personal satisfaction not just.
Obviously the application is usable and indeed suggestions and improvements are welcome both on the FE and BE side.
